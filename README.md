# VQGAN_Pytorch_Practise

### What is this repo for?

In order to have a deeper understanding of VQGAN and GPT models, I created this repo which contains a manually implemented VQGAN-Transformer.
A lot of these codes are inspired by this [repo](https://github.com/dome272/VQGAN-pytorch) 


### Dataset
The repo is tested on Oxford Flower dataset. To download it, click this [link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/)


### Environment Setup
```python
conda create -n _vqgan2 python=3.8
conda activate _vqgan2
pip install -r requriments.txt
```

### Run the code
1. First step: Train VQGAN
2. Second step: Train VQGAN-Transformer
